    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> and <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong> were important mathematicians.
        He wrote <em>800 different books and papers</em>. Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland and
        later studied under Bernoulli.
    </p>

    <p>
        Euler’s work <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite> was a major influence on mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the publication <cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d’Allemagne</cite> he wrote many explanations
        for mathematical ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
        Euler used the symbol <var>e</var> in many equations. He also used the symbol &pi; in his work.

<h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>

<p>Euler’s equation:</p>

<p>
    <var>e</var><sup>ix</sup> = cos(x) + i sin(x)
</p>

<p>The expression also shows:</p>

<p>
    <var>e</var><sup>i&pi;</sup> + 1 = 0
</p>

<p>
    This uses the values <var>e</var> and <var>i</var> and also uses the symbol &pi; again.
</p>

<p>
    This formula is often discussed in the journal <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>.
