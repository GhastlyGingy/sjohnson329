    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Sage, and I am currently working on AS in Computer Science. 
        I work as a cable technician where I troubleshoot internet, cable and phone services for residential and small to medium businesses.
        This is my first time practicing web design, and I look forward to developing these skills, making myself both knowledgeable and marketable after obtaining my degree and pursuing a new job.
        I am starting from scratch on this course but have some experience with the Python coding language and would like to see if I can implement these two skills together.<br><br>
        In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing video games, and learning new skills. 
        I am currently teaching myself to work on circuit boards and soldering. 
        I have begun modifying GameCube controllers with custom wires, painted shells, and replacement parts to improve performance.
        I ride a <em>Ninja 650</em> that I am currently putting work into so that I can trade it in or sell it next year to replace it with a <strong>Ninja 600 super sport bike.</strong>
        I look forward to what I am going to learn from this class and others this semester. Thank you for taking the time to review this!
